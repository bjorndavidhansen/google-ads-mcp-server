# Working Workflow Snippets - Reference

This directory contains snippets from the working parts of our GitHub Actions workflow (`cicd.yml`). These files serve as reliable reference points that we can use when making changes to the workflow.

## Purpose

These snippets are maintained as reference points we can use if we accidentally break working parts of the workflow. They represent known-good configurations that we can revert to if needed.

## Usage

When modifying the main workflow file, you can copy parts from these snippets to ensure you're using configurations that are known to work.

For example, if we accidentally break a step while making future improvements, we can copy the contents of the relevant snippet back into the main workflow.

## Success! 

We have successfully resolved the deployment issues by:

1. **Fixed FastMCP Integration**: Changed the FastMCP integration method from `mcp.mount_to_app(app)` to properly mount the MCP server at `/mcp` path using `app.mount("/mcp", mcp.sse_app())`.

2. **Image Tag Consistency**: Ensured consistent image tagging by using the full SHA in both build and deployment steps.

3. **Enhanced Kubernetes Configuration**: 
   - Added proper `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`
   - Added `preStop` lifecycle hooks
   - Set explicit `progressDeadlineSeconds`
   - Improved rolling update strategy

4. **CI/CD Improvements**:
   - Increased timeouts for deployment verification
   - Added comprehensive debugging
   - Consolidated workflow files

The workflow now successfully deploys the Google Ads MCP server to the Kubernetes cluster with proper health checks passing.
