# Test Coverage Analysis Report
**Date:** 2025-04-09

## Overview

This report documents the test coverage analysis performed for Task 3.2.1 of the FINALIZE-Plan. The analysis focused primarily on measuring current test coverage to identify gaps that need to be addressed in subsequent tasks.

## Initial Challenges

Before the analysis could be performed, several technical issues needed to be resolved:

1. **Encoding Issues and Null Bytes**: Several Python files contained invisible null bytes or had encoding issues that prevented proper module importing during tests.
2. **File Recovery**: A custom script (`clean_all.py`) was developed to detect and fix these issues throughout the codebase.
3. **Cache Clearing**: Python bytecode cache (`__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files) needed to be cleared to ensure clean testing.

## Test Coverage Results

After resolving these technical issues, coverage analysis was performed on a sampling of utility modules:

### Google Ads MCP Server Utils Module

| Module | Statements | Missing | Coverage |
|--------|------------|---------|----------|
| error_handler.py | 98 | 24 | 76% |
| formatting.py | 79 | 14 | 82% |

**Average Coverage (utils) = ~79%**

### Test Status Summary

* **Passing Tests**: Some utility modules have solid test coverage, with most of the core functionality well-tested.
* **Failing Tests**: Some minor test failures exist, such as an inconsistency in the `truncate_string` function behavior vs. test expectations.
* **Import Errors**: Several tests are failing due to missing validation functions, indicating refactoring has created dependency issues.

## Coverage Gaps Identified

1. **Error Handler Module (76%)**:
   * The `handle_google_ads_exception` function has some branch coverage gaps
   * Some special case error handling is untested
   * Error category/severity classification could use more test coverage

2. **Formatting Module (82%)**:
   * The `truncate_string` function has a test failure (behavior mismatch)
   * Some edge cases for date formatting are untested
   * Currency conversion functions could use more test coverage

3. **Validation Module**:
   * Discrepancy between validation function names in tests and implementation
   * Missing validation functions need to be implemented or renamed

## Next Steps

Based on the coverage analysis, the following steps are recommended to complete Task 3.2.6 (ensuring all tests pass consistently in CI):

1. **Fix Function Implementations**: Correct the behavior of `truncate_string` to match test expectations
2. **Resolve Module Dependencies**: Implement or properly name missing validation functions
3. **Expand Test Coverage**: Add tests to cover identified gaps in error handling and formatting modules
4. **Configure CI Pipeline**: Ensure tests run consistently within the Continuous Integration environment

This analysis has provided a foundation for further test enhancements as outlined in Tasks 3.2.2 through 3.2.6 of the FINALIZE-Plan.
