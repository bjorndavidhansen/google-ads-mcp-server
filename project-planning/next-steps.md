# Google Ads MCP Server Refactoring: Next Steps

## Current Status (2025-04-05)

We have successfully completed refactoring 50% of the MCP tools modules (4 out of 8):

✅ `campaign.py` - Comprehensive refactoring with validation, error handling, and logging
✅ `ad_group.py` - Added validation for string lengths, enums, dates, and numeric ranges
✅ `keyword.py` - Added validation for keyword text, match types, and bid values
✅ `health.py` - Added basic error handling and proper logging

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Refactor `search_term.py` (Estimated: 3 hours)

This medium-complexity module contains four key tools:
- `get_search_terms_report`
- `get_search_terms_report_json`
- `analyze_search_terms`
- `analyze_search_terms_json`

A detailed refactoring plan has been created in `project-planning/implementation-plans/search-term-refactoring-plan.md`. The main focus areas include:
- Adding validation for customer_id, campaign_id, ad_group_id, and date parameters
- Replacing manual customer ID formatting with `format_customer_id`
- Standardizing error responses with `create_error_response` and `handle_exception`
- Enhancing logging with context information

### 2. Refactor `budget.py` (Estimated: 3.5 hours)

This module requires special attention due to budget-specific considerations:
- Validation of budget amounts (must be positive)
- Proper conversion between dollars and micros
- Special handling for delivery method enum values

A detailed refactoring plan has been created in `project-planning/implementation-plans/budget-refactoring-plan.md`.

### 3. Prepare for Complex Modules

After completing the medium-complexity modules, we will need to plan for the more complex modules:

- `insights.py` - Complex module with anomaly detection that will require significant refactoring
- `dashboard.py` - Complex module with dashboard visualization formatting

## Implementation Schedule

| Task | Module | Complexity | Estimated Hours | Target Date |
|------|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | `search_term.py` | Medium | 3 | 2025-04-06 |
| 2 | `budget.py` | Medium | 3.5 | 2025-04-07 |
| 3 | Prepare detailed plan for `insights.py` | High | 1 | 2025-04-08 |
| 4 | Refactor `insights.py` | High | 5-6 | 2025-04-09 |
| 5 | Refactor `dashboard.py` | High | 4-5 | 2025-04-10 |

## Success Criteria

For each module refactoring, we will consider it complete when:

1. All validation, error handling, and logging patterns are consistently applied
2. All methods return standardized error responses
3. All customer ID formatting uses the utility functions
4. Basic testing confirms functionality with both valid and invalid inputs
5. Progress tracking is updated in the implementation plan

## Documentation Updates

After completing each module:
1. Update the progress tracking in FINALIZE-Plan.md
2. Create a detailed change log entry in logs/change-logs/
3. Update the progress entry in logs/change-logs/progress-2025-04-05.md

## Performance Considerations

As we continue to refactor modules, we'll need to be mindful of:
- Adding validation overhead to frequently called methods
- Ensuring error handling doesn't significantly impact performance
- Maintaining careful balance between validation thoroughness and performance

## Risk Management

1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to refactoring for validation, error handling, and logging without adding new features
2. **Integration Issues**: Test each module after refactoring to ensure it works with other components
3. **Time Management**: If a module takes longer than expected, consider splitting the work or adjusting the schedule

## Final Deliverables

By 2025-04-10, we aim to have:
- All 8 MCP tools modules fully refactored
- Comprehensive documentation of changes
- Updated progress tracking
- Full test coverage of validation and error handling
