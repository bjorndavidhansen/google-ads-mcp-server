## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Health Check Integration ✅

- **Implemented the health check module**
  - Created a dedicated `health.py` module with uptime tracking and component status
  - Added status formatting for human-readable display

- **Added MCP health endpoints**
  - Integrated text-based health status endpoint `get_health_status`
  - Added JSON-formatted health status endpoint `get_health_status_json` for visualization

- **Implemented HTTP health endpoint for container probes**
  - Added FastAPI integration for HTTP health check at `/health`
  - Configured proper status code responses (200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy)

- **Created testing scripts**
  - Added Python test script for local health check testing
  - Created Bash script for testing health endpoint in Docker container

### Phase 2: Docker Container Testing ✅

- **Updated Dockerfile**
  - Added health check module to Docker image
  - Configured environment variables for proper health reporting
  - Added container health check using HTTP endpoint

- **Enhanced docker-compose configuration**
  - Added health check module mounting
  - Configured development environment settings

- **Created test scripts for Docker validation**
  - Added script to test Docker container health endpoints
  - Configured proper error handling and reporting

### Phase 3: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline ✅

- **Created CI/CD workflow**
  - Implemented testing job to validate codebase
  - Added Docker build and push job with proper tagging
  - Created deployment job for test environment

- **Set up Kubernetes deployment**
  - Added namespace handling
  - Created secure secrets management for credentials
  - Configured rollout status checking

- **Added post-deployment validation**
  - Implemented health check validation after deployment
  - Added proper error handling for failed deployments

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: Test Environment Deployment (In Progress)

- Prepare Kubernetes test environment
- Deploy using CI/CD pipeline
- Validate end-to-end functionality
- Document deployment process

## Overall Status

Project Horizon is proceeding on schedule with three of four phases completed. The integration of health checks, Docker containerization, and CI/CD pipeline implementation has been successfully completed according to the plan.

The final phase of deploying to a test environment is in progress. This will validate the entire workflow from commit to deployment, ensuring the Google Ads MCP server meets all production readiness requirements.
