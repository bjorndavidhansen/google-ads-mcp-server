# Project NOVA ULTRA - Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## 1. Complete Task 2.2: SQLite-Based Caching

### Task 2.2.3: Debug Cache Retrieval Issues (Priority: HIGH)
- **Issue**: Cache storage works, but there are problems with retrieving cached data.
- **Actions**:
  1. Add more comprehensive debug logging to `get_api_response` in `DatabaseManager`
  2. Verify SQLite queries used for retrieving data, particularly datetime comparisons
  3. Test cache key generation consistency between storage and retrieval
  4. Create a dedicated test script that performs cache operations in sequence to isolate issues
  5. Fix identified issues in the implementation

### Task 2.2.4: Complete Cache Integration (Priority: HIGH)
- **Actions**:
  1. Update the factory method or initialization in `google_ads/client.py` to use `GoogleAdsServiceWithSQLiteCache` by default
  2. Update any services or methods that directly use the Google Ads client to use the cached version
  3. Ensure cache clearing is properly implemented for write operations
  4. Add configuration options for cache TTL and enabling/disabling the cache

### Task 2.2.5: Performance Testing (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Actions**:
  1. Run performance tests with caching enabled vs. disabled
  2. Measure and document improvement in response times
  3. Generate cache statistics reports (hit rates, sizes, etc.)
  4. Update the performance baseline documentation with new metrics

## 2. Continue Task 2.3: API Call Optimization

### Task 2.3.2: Query Optimization (Priority: HIGH)
- **Actions**:
  1. Integrate the `APICallTracker` with `GoogleAdsServiceWithSQLiteCache` to track actual API usage
  2. Review all GAQL queries in the codebase, focusing on:
     - Selecting only necessary fields (`SELECT` clause optimization)
     - Efficient filtering (`WHERE` clause optimization)
     - Using appropriate time ranges for historical data
  3. Update the queries to use optimized versions
  4. Implement field selection logic to allow clients to request only needed fields

### Task 2.3.3: Request Batching Assessment (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Actions**:
  1. Identify operations that might benefit from batching (keyword status updates, ad group changes)
  2. Research Google Ads API batch capabilities and limitations
  3. Create proof-of-concept implementation for at least one batch operation
  4. Document findings and recommendations

## 3. Complete Task 2.6: Budget Modification API Calls

### Task 2.6.2: Update BudgetService (Priority: HIGH)
- **Actions**:
  1. Locate the `BudgetService` implementation (likely in `google_ads/budgets.py`)
  2. Update its `update_budget` method to use the `update_campaign_budget` method from `GoogleAdsServiceWithSQLiteCache`
  3. Ensure proper error handling and response formatting
  4. Add logging for budget update operations

### Task 2.6.3: Update MCP Tool (Priority: HIGH)
- **Actions**:
  1. Locate the budget update MCP tool (likely in `mcp/tools.py`)
  2. Update it to use the enhanced `BudgetService.update_budget` method
  3. Ensure it provides proper feedback to the user/LLM
  4. Perform manual testing to verify functionality

### Task 2.6.4: Testing (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Actions**:
  1. Create unit tests for `BudgetService.update_budget`
  2. Create/update integration tests for the budget update MCP tool
  3. Document test scenarios and expected results

## 4. Start Task 2.4: Data Processing Optimization

### Task 2.4.1: Profiling (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Actions**:
  1. Identify specific data transformation and aggregation functions to profile
  2. Set up profiling for these functions using `cProfile` or similar tools
  3. Execute profiling runs and collect data
  4. Analyze results to identify specific bottlenecks

## 5. Start Task 2.5: Visualization Optimization

### Task 2.5.1: Visualization Profiling (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Actions**:
  1. Identify specific visualization generation functions to profile
  2. Profile the functions to measure time spent on different operations
  3. Analyze where time is being spent (data retrieval, transformation, formatting)
  4. Document findings for subsequent optimization work

## Timeline

### Week 1 (Next 3-4 Days)
- Complete Task 2.2.3: Debug Cache Retrieval Issues
- Complete Task 2.2.4: Complete Cache Integration
- Complete Task 2.6.2 & 2.6.3: Budget Service & MCP Tool Updates

### Week 2 (Following 3-4 Days)
- Complete Task 2.3.2: Query Optimization
- Complete Task 2.2.5 & 2.6.4: Performance Testing
- Start Task 2.4.1: Data Processing Profiling
- Start Task 2.5.1: Visualization Profiling

This plan prioritizes the completion of already-started tasks and ensures that the most critical functionality (caching and budget updates) is completed first, before moving on to optimization work.
