# Google Ads MCP Server - Finalization and Testing Plan (FINALIZE)
**Date:** 2025-04-05

## 1. Goal

Finalize the Google Ads MCP Server modularization project by ensuring comprehensive integration of utility modules, enhancing test coverage, updating documentation, verifying performance, and preparing the codebase for stable operation.

## 2. Scope

### In Scope:

*   **Integration Verification**: Systematically review all core modules (`google_ads`, `mcp`, `visualization`, `server`, `main`) to ensure consistent and correct usage of `utils` modules (`formatting`, `validation`, `error_handler`, `logging`).
*   **Test Coverage Enhancement**: Augment existing unit and integration tests to cover edge cases, error paths, and interactions involving the new utility modules. Aim for a target coverage percentage (e.g., 85%).
*   **Documentation Finalization**: Update all relevant documentation (READMEs, module docs, developer guides) to accurately reflect the final modular architecture and usage patterns.
*   **Performance Benchmarking**: Conduct basic performance tests to ensure modularization hasn't introduced significant regressions in key API call response times or resource usage.
*   **Final Code Review**: Perform a codebase-wide review for consistency, adherence to style guides, removal of dead code, and best practices.
*   **Changelog Generation**: Generate a final changelog summarizing the modularization effort.

### Out of Scope:

*   New feature development unrelated to modularization.
*   Major architectural changes beyond the established modular structure.
*   Extensive performance optimization (only verification against regressions).
*   User interface changes (as this is a server component).

    *   **Mitigation**: Focus coverage on critical paths and error handling; document areas with lower coverage if necessary.
*   **Risk**: Performance regressions identified during testing.
    *   **Mitigation**: Profile affected code sections; optimize utility function usage or specific module implementations causing bottlenecks.
*   **Risk**: Inconsistencies found during final code review.
