2. Validate that optimized GAQL queries retrieve the correct data while reducing response sizes
3. Confirm that pagination works correctly for large result sets
4. Measure performance improvements gained from batch processing
5. Ensure that all API optimizations maintain data integrity and correctness
6. Establish new performance baselines for key operations
